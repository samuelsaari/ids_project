	\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
	
	%%%% Define a research territory (1)
	%% General context of the work (1a)  
	%% Narrower research area and statement of its importance (1b)
	Play\textemdash coming together to engage in a common activity\textemdash is a human universal \autocite{brownHumanUniversalsHuman2004} and essential part in human development \autocite{smithPlayTypesFunctions2005,pellegriniRolePlayHuman2009}. Board games are a popular and accessible form of play that bring family, friends and strangers alike together, and promote well-being across the life-span \autocite{dellangelaBoardGamesEmotional2020,solway2011wellness}.

	%%%% Establish a niche (2)
	%% Identification of a gap or other need for research (2a)
	% Specific research question meeting the identified need (2b)
	But what if a group of people have outplayed the games they own and would like to find some new ones? There are at least 150.000 different board games out there \autocite{wordsratedBoardGamesStatistics2025} so finding a good match can be a time consuming process. A service that would suggest new board games based on the individual taste could come in handy on such occasions.
	
	%%% Summary
	% Summary of approach to answer the research question 3a
	%Announcement of principal findings
	This technical report will outline the steps we made to create a recommendation system for new board games based on the user's ratings in BoardGameGeek.com (BBG) database as well as the technical details of setting up a webpage *LINK TO WEBSITE* through which users can find recommendations for new board games. To achieve this, we used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with a selected users' review scores to create tailored suggestions for new board games.

	%%%% Data and Methods
	
	
	\section{Data}\label{data}

	%BBG Data

	Since there are 2.7 million users  and 150.000 boardgames in BBG \autocite{didymus-trueBoardGameGeeksSupportDrive2024,wordsratedBoardGamesStatistics2025}, fetching all of them would not be feasible with the API interface, at least within this project. Since many users have left no or few reviews, the data would be too sparse if we had taken a random sample. To get a compromise between training matrix sparsity, time constraints and selection bias, we decided to choose x guilds (online discussion groups) that represent different geographic regions, target audiences (teens, parents, seniors), genres as well as general and special interest groups. This way we could get X reviews from Y reviewers about Z games. The sampling strategy did bias our distribution towards active users, but also allows for reliable training. Users with only few reviews would make the estimation computationally intensive and possibly unreliable.
