	%%%% Data and Methods
	
	
	\section{Data and Methods}\label{datamethods}
	
	Statistics Finland registers a cohabition if two people of the opposite sex coreside for more than 90 days and their age difference is less than 16 years, unless they have common children. Therefore we restrict to unions with age difference less than 16 years. 
	
	If divorce date was missing for a couple but they had moved a part, we considered such cases having ended in a divorce.

	\subsection{Multi-state modelling}

	We model the relationship status transitions as an irreversible illness-death model \autocite{cookMultistateModelsAnalysis2017} (REF FIND PAGE), where cohabitation, marriage and separation or divorce correspond to healthy, ill and dead, respectively.

	We discretize time into four quarters annually, as the minimum length of a union is three months. Using a discrete time multi-state framework \autocite{dudelet.al.DiscretetimeMultistateModelsUpcoming}, we can model the transitions within quarters, as the probabilities are obtained from multinomial logistic regression. The equivalent to continuous time would be hazard ratios. (CHECK!! As the industry standard for multi-state modelling is continuous time, we will perform robustness checks with that.)
	
	
	%
	Instead of hazard ratio's, we will display the probability of a transition within a quarter. 
	
	The markov assumption is not needed (DELETE?? for the majority of metrics, and even for those that would technically require it, the violations are often minor) for the life-time risk *ADD DUDEL ET AL* %\autocite{dudelet.al.DiscretetimeMultistateModelsUpcoming}
